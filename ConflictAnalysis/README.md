The files in this directory are related to an investigation into problems found in the Ethica data for Wave 1. In a nutshell, the data has a high degree of redundancy, with approximately 2-3 times as many samples as expected. 

Investigation revealed that many samples were recorded multiple times, and many more were recorded with conflicting timestamps (but different sensor readings.)

These scripts and results were produced in an effort to understand the nature of these redundancies and to then see if they can be filtered effectively to produce a reliable data stream.
