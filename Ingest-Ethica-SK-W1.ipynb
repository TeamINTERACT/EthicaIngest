    "# Ingest Log for Ethica, Saskatoon, Wave 1\n",
    "\n",
    "After much investigation and discussion, we have decided to ingest the data in its raw form, with no filters applied, and then create a few obvious subtables from that ingested data. The reasoning is that, due to the nature of the data issues, there appears to be no single cleaning filter we can apply that will be appropriate for all downstream analysis. So we'll ingest the raw table, mark it as toxic so nobody uses it by accident, and then create a few sane starting points that people can actually use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're going to have multiple tables like this, we'll want to standardize the table naming conventions. Currently, tables are broken into different schemas based on the temporal resolution, but since all of these starting filters will still have raw-level timing, we'll need to name them with that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Filters\n",
    "There are two fundamental steps to the filters we've applied during the investigation phase: Prefiltration and uniquification. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prefiltration\n",
    "The incoming raw data is messy and conflicted. Some records are pure singletons, meaning that they are unique on userid, timestamp, and sensor values. Other records are true duplicates, meaning they occur multiple times but have identical userid, time, and sensor values. We call these \"singleon-equivalent,\" since they can be reduced to singletons by simply deleting all but one occurrence. And then there are \"conflicted duplicates,\" for which there are many records with identical userid and timestamp, but that report multiple conflicting sensor readings within the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential causes of the various kinds of duplicates are numerous: there could be hiccups with different versions of the host phone's OS, memory constraint problems on specific user's phones, different user preference settings, differing versions of the Ethica collection software, various types of power and service outages, etc. At this point, we have not yet found any way to attribute causes to the observed effects. And since we don't know the causes, we cannot use metadata as a way to screen the telemetry records. What we *can* do is use the attributes of the duplicates themselves as an indicator of the data's reliability and choose which ones to from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Singletons vs Singleton-Equivalent vs Conflicted\n",
    "It turns out that the vast majority of the duplicates occur in tight bursts, for just short periods of time. And since we don't know why the duplicates are there, the safest course might be that we should simply eliminate all duplicated records. But this would throw out all the singleton-equivalent records as well, so a second scheme was explored in which we keep the singleton and singleton-equivalent records, but filter out the conflicted duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are even deeper wrinkles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Record Time vs Satellite Time\n",
    "The GPS data contains four different temporal fields. One contains only the year/month and the other is an undocumented internal counter used by the Ethica software. The remaining two (record_time and satellite_time) both encode complete date and time, down to the millisecond. The record_time field is captured from the host phone's clock, and notes the time at which the sensor was read, while the satellite_time field is taken from the GPS signal and represents the time the signal was broadcast from orbit. In theory, these two fields should only deviate by a small number of milliseconds, but in practice, they at times differ wildly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Worse, the duplication of times mentioned above occurs in both fields, but not in any linear, predictable fashion. Sometimes the satellite time is repeated at multiple differing record times, sometimes it's the other way around, and in some cases, they actually agree. So the result of prefiltering the duplicates will change depending on which time field is used as the timestamp of record. For research that needs only GPS data, the satellite_time seems to be the most reliable. But the record_time stamp is the only temporal field available in the accelerometry (XL) table, so any analysis that needs to synchronize the two tables is forced to use record_time as the timestamp of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uniquification\n",
    "Depending on which method(s) were used to identify and remove the \"unreliable\" records, there can still be duplication present in the dataset, so the next step is to eliminate the duplicates so that only well-ordered, unique observations remain to be fed to the analysis algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to confuse the prefiltration and uniquification steps, as they tend to use the same fields and similar criteria, but they need to be considered as distinct operations, because their intended functions differ. Prefiltration is a process of identifying and eliminating records that may be associated with dubious/unreliable behavior in the capture system, but it does not necessarily remove all duplicates from the table, which is what uniquification aims to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better sense of why we keep the two steps distinct, consider the following scenario: Suppose we decide to reject GPS records with duplicated satellite_times but differing lat/lon values, because we believe that *those* are clearly caused by some kind of hiccup in the phone and should be rejected. Doing so would indeed filter out the data we've marked as unreliable, but it would still leave singleton-equivalent duplicates intact, which would be squashed in the uniquification step. \n",
    "\n",
    "And after doing all that, we might then want to link the GPS and XL table by their record_time fields, which would trigger a *third* filtration step, squashing the record_time duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming convention\n",
    "With all the above in mind, we've devised a naming convention to help identify the contents of the various filtered tables. Each filtration step can be summarized by a fairly terse string: \"delconflsat\" would indicate that we **del**eted all **confl**icted records based on **sat**ellite_time, while \"delduplsat\" reports that we **del**eted all **dupl**icates on that field, instead of just the conflicted ones. For all cases other than the raw table, when duplicated records are not deleted, they are instead \"uniquified\" by collapsing them to single records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tables created at ingest time will be the raw tables, loaded as-is from the incoming data, complete with duplicates and conflicts. Other tables can then take their names by adding on the tag(s) of the filtration steps applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the table called \"ssk-w1-eth-gps-delconflrec\" indicates that the GPS table was filtered to remove all conflicted record_times, while ssk-w1-eth-xls-delduplsat means the XLS table was filtered to remove all duplicates on the satellite_time field.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: As an added precaution, the raw tables have the tag \"TOXIC\" appended to remind researchers not to use its content directly for analysis.)"
